How to play:
- WASD keys to move
- 1,2,3,4,5,6 to select textures
- Click to spawn a cube
- Hold SHIFT key and click to remove a cube


## Libraries and tools used

- Zustand for state management.
- Three.js.
- React Fiber, Drei for Three.js hooks and components.
- React Cannon for physics.
- nanoid for unique keys for react components.

- For textures: (Stable Diffusion) AI generated images using the following addon for Blender: https://github.com/carson-katri/dream-textures, end result is kind of weird, but i wanted to try this out!
